# NBA Simulation App
This full stack app allows you to create two teams of 1-5 NBA players each and see which team is more likely to win based on the stats of all the players on each team. You can add any players that has played in the NBA as far back as 1979. The way it determines the winner of the two teams is it takes all the stats from all the players from the home team and averages them up, does the same thing for the away team, and then compares the stats of the two teams. If you like a team, you can add it to your saved teams. You can also search up any NBA player to see their stats for any season that you select
